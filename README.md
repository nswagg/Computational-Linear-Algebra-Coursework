# Computational-Linear-Algebra-Coursework
Course taken Fall of 2020 at University of Colorado Colorado Springs
Each file includes tags of which topics are covered in the project.
Code is not optimized and it is very likely that more efficient solutions are available.
Each project should also have a description of the calculations and processes occuring internally.

This course covered basic 2D matrix  and tensor (3D matrices) manipulation. 

Tags: file i/o, implicit form, parametric form, point normal, vector, cross product, augment, plane, focal point, rotation, homogeneous, multiply matrix, coordinate, matrix, matrix manipulation, 3d vectors, transpose
